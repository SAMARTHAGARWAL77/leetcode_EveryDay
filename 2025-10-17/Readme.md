ðŸ“Œ Problem Description

You are given a string s and an integer k. The task is to partition the string into the maximum number of substrings such that:

Each substring contains at most k distinct characters.

You are allowed to change at most one character in the entire string to any other lowercase English letter (aâ€“z).

The goal is to compute the maximum number of such valid substrings after optionally changing one character.

ðŸ”§ Method Signature
int maxPartitionsAfterOperations(string s, int k);

ðŸ›  Core Concepts Used

Bitmasking to track unique characters

Dynamic Programming with memoization

Recursive exploration with branching

State compression using bit manipulation

ðŸ”¢ Step-by-Step Breakdown
âœ… Step 1: Understand the Constraints

Each substring must have â‰¤ k distinct letters.

At most one character change is allowed across the string.

Try to greedily maximize partitions based on valid groups.

âœ… Step 2: Recursive State Representation

The recursive solve function is defined by the state:

i: current index in string s

mask: bitmask representing unique characters in current substring

change: whether a character change has been used (0 or 1)

k: maximum allowed unique characters

Memoization with a compressed key:

currState = (i << 27) | (mask << 1) | change

âœ… Step 3: Base and Recursive Cases

Base Case: If i == s.size(), a valid end is reached. Return 1.

Recursive Case:

If adding current character exceeds k distinct characters:

Start a new partition and recurse.

Else:

Continue with current partition.

If change == 0: Try all possible substitutions at this index (simulate 1 character change) and compute maximum.

âœ… Step 4: Memoization

Use an unordered_map<long long, int> to memoize previously computed states for efficiency.

This avoids recomputation across overlapping subproblems.

ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

-> ðŸ•’ Time	O(n * 2^k * 26) (approximation due to bitmask and branching)
-> ðŸ’¾ Space	O(n * 2^k) (for memoization map)
