ðŸ“Œ Problem Description:

Given a list of words (wordlist) and a list of queries (queries), the goal is to return the corrected version of each query based on the following rules:

Exact Match (case-sensitive) â†’ return the word.

Case-Insensitive Match â†’ return the first matching word from the wordlist.

Vowel Error Match â†’ replace all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) with * and match case-insensitively.

If no match â†’ return an empty string.

ðŸš€ Approach:

Use a HashSet to store exact words for O(1) lookup.

Use a HashMap for:

Case-insensitive matches (key: lowercase).

Vowel-error matches (key: devoweled lowercase, where vowels are replaced with *).

For each query, check in order:

Exact match in the set.

Case-insensitive match in the map.

Devoweled match in the map.

Return the first match based on the order above, or an empty string if none match

ðŸ“Š Complexity Analysis:

ðŸ•’ Time Complexity	O(N + Q * L) where N = wordlist.length, Q = queries.length, L = average word length
ðŸ§  Space Complexity	O(N * L) for storing the maps and sets
