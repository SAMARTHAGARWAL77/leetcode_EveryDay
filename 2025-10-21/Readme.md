ðŸ“Œ Problem Description

You are given:

An integer array nums

Two integers: k (range flexibility) and numOperations (maximum number of changes allowed)

Each element in nums can be adjusted up or down within a range of Â±k, but the total number of adjusted elements cannot exceed numOperations.

The goal is to maximize the frequency of any single number in the array after performing at most numOperations.

ðŸ”§ Method Signature
int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k, int numOperations)

ðŸ›  Core Concepts Used

Frequency Counting

Prefix Sum Array

Range-based Optimization

Greedy Decision Making for maximizing frequency under constraints

ðŸ”¢ Step-by-Step Breakdown
âœ… Step 1: Determine Range (min/max)

Find the minimum and maximum values in the array to establish the bounds for processing.

int max = 0, min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
for (int i : nums) {
    max = Math.max(max, i);
    min = Math.min(min, i);
}

âœ… Step 2: Build Frequency and Prefix Arrays

Count the frequency of each number

Construct a prefix sum array for quick range sum queries

int[] freq = new int[max + 1];
int[] prefix = new int[max + 1];

for (int i : nums) {
    freq[i]++;
}
for (int i = min; i <= max; i++) {
    prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + freq[i];
}

âœ… Step 3: Iterate and Compute Max Frequency

For each value i in the range:

Define a window from i - k to i + k

Calculate how many numbers within that window could potentially be changed to i

Compute how many operations it would take to do this

Use only up to numOperations allowed

for (int i = min; i <= max; i++) {
    int low = (i - k - 1 > 0) ? prefix[i - k - 1] : 0;
    int high = (i + k <= max) ? prefix[i + k] : prefix[max];

    int toChange = high - low - freq[i]; // exclude current freq[i] to avoid double counting

    ans = Math.max(ans, freq[i] + Math.min(toChange, numOperations));
}

ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

-> ðŸ•’ Time Complexity: O(n + r)
Where n is the number of elements in nums, and r is the range between min and max values

-> ðŸ’¾ Space Complexity: O(r)
Due to frequency and prefix sum arrays of size max + 1
