ðŸ“Œ Class Description

The Solution class provides a method to compute the largest triangle area that can be formed by any three points in a given set of 2D points.

Given an array of points where each point is represented as [x, y], the method largestTriangleArea checks every combination of three points and calculates the area of the triangle they form. It returns the maximum area found.

This problem is a classic brute-force approach over all triplets of points, leveraging the formula for the area of a triangle from its vertex coordinates.

ðŸ”§ Method Signature
public double largestTriangleArea(int[][] points)

ðŸ§  Internal Logic Summary
ðŸ“¥ Input

A 2D integer array points where points[i] = [x_i, y_i] represents the coordinates of the ith point on the 2D plane.

ðŸ›  Approach: Brute Force + Area Calculation
ðŸ”¢ Step-by-step Logic

Initialize an integer variable ans to store the maximum doubled area found so far (area calculation will initially be twice the actual area).

Iterate through all unique triplets (i, j, k) where i < j < k.

Extract the x and y coordinates of the three points.

Update ans with the maximum of the current ans and the absolute value of this calculated area.

After iterating through all triplets, return ans / 2.0 to get the actual largest triangle area.

ðŸ“¦ Data Structures Used

int[][] points: 2D array input representing points in the 2D plane.

Simple integer variables for loop indices and intermediate calculations.

ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

-> ðŸ•’ Time Complexity: O(nÂ³), where n is the number of points.
-> ðŸ§  Space Complexity: O(1) extra space, aside from the input array and constant variables
