ðŸ“Œ Class Description

The Solution class provides a method to determine the largest perimeter of a triangle that can be formed from any three integers in a given array, where the integers represent side lengths.

The core idea is based on the Triangle Inequality Theorem â€” the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. The method checks from the largest possible side combinations (after sorting) and returns the maximum valid perimeter found.

ðŸ”§ Method Signature

public int largestPerimeter(int[] nums)


ðŸ§  Internal Logic Summary

ðŸ“¥ Input
An integer array nums where each element represents a potential triangle side length.

ðŸ“¤ Output
An integer value representing the largest perimeter of a triangle that can be formed. Returns 0 if no valid triangle can be formed.

ðŸ›  Approach: Greedy + Triangle Inequality

ðŸ”¢ Step-by-step Logic

Sort the array in non-decreasing order to make it easier to apply the triangle inequality rule on the largest sides.

Iterate backwards from the third-last element to the beginning:

At each step, check if the current element plus the next one is greater than the next-next one (i.e., nums[i] + nums[i+1] > nums[i+2]).

If true, these three elements can form a triangle, and their sum is the maximum perimeter possible due to sorting.

Return 0 if no such triplet is found.

ðŸ“¦ Data Structures Used

int[] nums: The input array storing potential side lengths.

Basic integer variables for indexing and storing the result.

ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

-> ðŸ•’ Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
-> ðŸ§  Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place operations except for sorting).
