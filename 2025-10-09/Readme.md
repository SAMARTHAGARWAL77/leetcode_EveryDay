📌 Problem Description

Given two arrays:

skill: representing the skill level of each worker

mana: representing the mana applied on each day

The goal is to calculate the minimum time (or cost) to perform a task across multiple skill/mana combinations, with some internal logic involving cumulative and prefix computations.

Although the exact problem isn't explicitly defined, based on the structure and use of prefix sums, it's likely solving a variant of a cumulative weighted task processing problem.

🧠 Approach Overview

The algorithm uses a greedy + prefix sum approach:

Iterates over the mana array (likely representing days or stages).

For each mana[i], multiplies it with each skill level to calculate a cost.

Uses a prefix sum array (pre) to compute and compare cumulative costs.

Keeps track of:

st: Maximum differential between current total and prefix sum.

end: Cumulative weighted time cost for all skills and mana up to that point.

⚙️ Method Signature
long long minTime(vector<int>& skill, vector<int>& mana);

📥 Parameters:

skill: vector<int> — skill levels of workers

mana: vector<int> — mana values (likely per time unit or task)

📤 Returns:

long long: The calculated minimum total time/cost based on the logic

🧩 Step-by-Step Logic
Initialization:
int s = skill.size(), m = mana.size();
vector<ll> pre(s + 1, 0);
ll st = 0, end = 0;


pre: Prefix sum array to store cumulative values per skill index

st: Stores max value from a differential operation (purpose unclear without context)

end: Accumulates total time or cost across iterations

Outer Loop (Mana Iteration):
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    end = st;


Each iteration represents using mana[i]

Resets end to st to begin a new cumulative computation

Inner Loop (Skill Iteration):
for (int j = 0; j < s; j++) {
    if (i + 1 < m) {
        pre[j + 1] = pre[j] + (ll)skill[j] * (ll)mana[i + 1];
    }
    end += (ll)skill[j] * (ll)mana[i];
    st = max(st, end - pre[j]);
}


For each skill j:

Precompute next stage's cost with mana[i+1] and store in pre[j+1]

Accumulate current stage's cost to end

Update st as the max of itself and end - pre[j] (tracking cost difference)

Final Return:
return end;


Returns the cumulative result of all skill × mana computations.
