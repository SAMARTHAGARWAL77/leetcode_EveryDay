ðŸ“Œ Class Description

The Solution class provides a method to analyze an array of integers and compute the total number of elements that have the highest frequency in the array.

This is particularly useful in problems where we want to measure dominance of elements or frequency clustering in a dataset.

The core method, maxFrequencyElements, finds the maximum frequency of any number in the array and then calculates how many elements appear with that frequency, returning the sum of those occurrences.

ðŸ”§ Method Signature
public int maxFrequencyElements(int[] nums)

ðŸ§  Internal Logic Summary

Frequency Counting
A HashMap is used to count how many times each number appears.

Determine Max Frequency
Iterate through the frequency map to find the maximum frequency among all elements.

Count Max Frequency Elements
Iterate again to count how many elements have this maximum frequency.

Final Result
Multiply the count of max-frequency elements by the frequency itself to get the total number of elements contributing to this max frequency.

ðŸ“¦ Data Structures Used

HashMap<Integer, Integer>: To store frequency counts.

ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

-> Time Complexity	O(n)
-> Space Complexity	O(n) (for map)

Where n is the number of elements in the input array nums.
