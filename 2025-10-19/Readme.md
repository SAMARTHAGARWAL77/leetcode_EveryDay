ðŸ“Œ Problem Description

You are given a string s consisting of digits and two integers a and b. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing any combination of two operations:

Add Operation: For each odd-indexed digit, increase its value by a (mod 10).

Rotate Operation: Rotate the string s by b positions to the right.

You must perform these operations as many times as necessary, but only once at a time for each operation.

The task is to determine the lexicographically smallest string that can be generated after applying any combination of the operations.

ðŸ”§ Method Signature
public String findLexSmallestString(String s, int a, int b);

ðŸ›  Core Concepts Used

Breadth-First Search (BFS): To explore all possible strings generated from s using the given operations.

Queue: Used to maintain a list of strings that can be processed.

Set: To track visited strings and prevent unnecessary recalculations.

String Manipulation: Modifying the string's digits and rotating the string based on the operations.

ðŸ”¢ Step-by-Step Breakdown
âœ… Step 1: Initialize the BFS Queue and Visited Set

Start with the string s and initialize a queue to explore all possible states (generated strings).

Create a HashSet to track visited strings and avoid cycles.

Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
Set<String> vis = new HashSet<>();
String ans = s;

âœ… Step 2: Perform BFS to Generate All Possible Strings

While the queue is not empty, process the current string.

For each string, apply the following operations:

Add Operation: Modify every odd-indexed digit by adding a (mod 10).

Rotate Operation: Rotate the string by b positions to the right.

For both operations, check if the new string has already been visited. If not, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.

String addOp = applyAddOperation(curr, a);
if (vis.add(addOp)) q.offer(addOp);

String rotateOp = applyRotateOperation(curr, b);
if (vis.add(rotateOp)) q.offer(rotateOp);

âœ… Step 3: Track the Lexicographically Smallest String

During the BFS process, compare the current string with the smallest string found so far and update if necessary.

if (curr.compareTo(ans) < 0) ans = curr;

âœ… Step 4: Return the Lexicographically Smallest String

Once all possibilities have been explored, return the lexicographically smallest string.

return ans;

ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

-> Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is the number of unique strings explored, and M is the length of the string s. Each operation (add and rotate) takes O(M) time to process.

-> Space Complexity: O(N * M) due to the queue and the visited set storing all possible strings.
